MiMo-V2-Flash is an open-source foundation language model developed by Xiaomi. It is a Mixture-of-Experts model with 309B total parameters and 15B active parameters, adopting hybrid attention architecture. MiMo-V2-Flash supports a hybrid-thinking toggle and a 256K context window, and excels at reasoning, coding, and agent scenarios. On SWE-bench Verified and SWE-bench Multilingual, MiMo-V2-Flash ranks as the top #1 open-source model globally, delivering performance comparable to Claude Sonnet 4.5 while costing only about 3.5% as much.

Note: when integrating with agentic tools such as Claude Code, Cline, or Roo Code, turn off reasoning mode for the best and fastest performance—this model is deeply optimized for this scenario.

Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the reasoning enabled boolean.
